# **Smart India Hackathon 2024 - Team DevDynamos**

## **Project Overview**

This repository contains the code for the project developed by Team DevDynamos for the Smart India Hackathon 2024. The project focuses on building a comprehensive web-based application aimed at helping Indian coal mines quantify their carbon footprint and explore pathways to achieve carbon neutrality.

## **Features**

- **Emission Estimation:**
  - Calculates carbon emissions based on various mining activities, such as excavation, transportation, and equipment usage.
  - Estimates per capita emissions of a mine.

- **Carbon Neutrality Pathways:**
  - Simulates the impact of adopting clean technologies, including electric vehicles, methane capture systems, and renewable energy sources.
  - Calculates the afforestation required to offset remaining emissions.
  - Explores other renewable energy alternatives and estimates potential carbon credits.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Visualizes emission trends and the effectiveness of different emission reduction strategies using charts and graphs.

- **Scalability:**
  - Designed to accommodate different mine sizes and types (underground vs. open-cast).

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

- **Backend:**
  - Flask, Django, MySQL

- **Other Technologies:**
  - GitHub, PowerBI

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash git clone
    https://github.com/harshnamd/compititional-coding
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Smart-India-Hackathon-2024-Team-DevDynamos--Main-REPO
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   - For the frontend, open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the application.
   - For the backend, follow the instructions in the `backend/` directory to set up Flask, Django, and MySQL.

## **Usage**

1. **Input Data:**
   - Enter the details about your mine, including type, location, and activities.
   - Provide data on energy consumption, equipment usage, and workforce.

2. **View Emissions:**
   - The application calculates and displays the mine’s total carbon emissions, along with per capita emissions.

3. **Simulate Carbon Neutrality Strategies:**
   - Explore different emission reduction strategies and view their impact on the mine’s carbon footprint.

4. **Generate Reports:**
   - Visualize the results using graphs and generate downloadable reports for further analysis.
